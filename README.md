# WindowsGSM.Spigot
WindowsGSM plugin for supporting Minecraft: Spigot Server

## Requirements
[WindowsGSM](https://github.com/WindowsGSM/WindowsGSM) >= 1.21.0

## Installation
1. Download the [latest](https://github.com/1stian/WindowsGSM.Spigot/releases/latest) release
1. Move **Spigot.cs** folder to **plugins** folder
1. Click **[RELOAD PLUGINS]** button or restart WindowsGSM

## Heads-UP!
First time install of servers, can take up to 15-30mins. Depending on your PC/server and/or internet speed.
Updatating will not take as much time. Do not delete **build** folder from the serverfiles directory. During the instalation, it can seem it's getting stuck or frozen at some times. This is because how BuildTools run that compiles the spigot.jar. But don't worry, it's going about doing its things. So just hold on and drink a coffee!
